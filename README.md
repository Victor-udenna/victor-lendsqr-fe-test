### Data Persistence

User details are stored and retrieved using **localStorage** / **IndexedDB** so that individual user profile data persists across page navigations without re-fetching.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully mobile responsive, adapting layouts across:

- **Mobile** — `< 768px`
- **Tablet** — `768px – 1024px`
- **Desktop** — `> 1024px`

---

---

## 🎨 Design Decisions

- **SCSS Modules** used per component for scoped styles and zero class conflicts
- **Component-first architecture** — every UI element is broken into reusable, testable components

---
